If they could make this product properly it would be perfect. But it was a bit of a train wreck. I got excited because of so many positive reviews but after building two there seems to be some quality control issues. One night stand came missing a few bits of hardware. The other had too many pieces of hardware. Some pre-drilled holes didn’t lined up, which was a bit of a pain. Then two pieces were the wrong length entirely. The top pieces of the nightstand are two different sizes so we have one with an overhang and one that is flush in the front, it’s not the end of the world but when you order matching nightstands you expect them to be the same. The icing on the cake is that they also have a bit of a wobble from side to side. One significantly more than the other but I triple checked that everything was screwed in properly and can’t figure out what else to do about it. I love the look of this nightstand. I just wish it was manufactured properly.
