Prep for weeknight meals and Sunday brunches with this versatile kitchen island. It features two cabinets with molded paneling that open to reveal room for dishes, glasses, and office supplies, while three drawers accommodate cutlery and linens. We love that the thick butcher block surface gives you lots of room for slicing and dicing. This island is made from solid and engineered wood with a finish of your choice, and it rests on a plinth-style base. Chrome-finished metal hardware rounds out this piece. Plus, the other side of the island is ideal for adding the barstools of your choice (sold separately).
