Nice chair. It was very simple to put together. I liked that the instructions gave a tip to use the box while putting the chair together. It really helped because it was the perfect width. The seat is a linen blend so I think it will not take on as much color as my velvet chair did. I changed the standard wheels to upgraded ones that I had on my previous chair. There are two things I don't like about the chair. It tips forward when getting out of it. Seems the legs should have come out a little further to avoid this. The netting on the back is gray. It should have been white or beige to match the other parts of the chair.
