This kitchen Island is great! It is large and almost the same height as my counters. I am using it as a "sideboard" and not an eat at island. A few things to note that might be helpful: I live alone in a 3rd floor walkup and I neglected to take into account the size and weight of this item. The packaging of this is huge and is over 100 pounds. I had to dismantle the master carton on the ground floor and carry every piece up (and there are a lot). Make sure you have a rather large area to put this item together, you will need to space. Don't over tighten the screws for the plastic drawer panel holders (you will know what I mean when you see them) they will break, nothing a little super glue couldn't fix... but you have been warned. Living alone, I was concerned about getting the item in its final spot, so I put the shell of the item basically where I wanted it and then installed the top, added the drawers and doors. For the doors, make sure the doors close properly and don't scrap, before you tighten all the screws. Finally, I used a manual screw driver and it took me about 4-5 hours to put it fully together, granted I was watching tv at the same time but be prepared to take the time.
