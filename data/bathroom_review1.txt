Perfect little unit for what bathroom storage. It did take a solid 2 hours to put it together, but it was easy and the instructions were fairly direct. I knocked a star off because there was this one piece that holds the cabinet door in place that definitely didn't come with the proper screws. I ended up just fashioning it in without, and will end up using a wood glue to secure it (as with opening the door, the piece will slide out over time if I dont't). I feel like for the price I paid, something like that was expected, lol.
