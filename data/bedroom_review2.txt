I really enjoy these stands. They were simple to assemble. One of the nightstands had quite a few scuffs on the melamine surface, but somehow they all ended up being on the internal side of the piece so I can't see a single one of them - crazy lucky. The height is nice in that it's right below the surface of the bed top, makes it easy to grab things off of it, etc. The storage is very nice to have bedside. Definitely recommend! Edit: Make sure to use coasters, the melamine surface has bubbled on the top due to condensation from a glass. Since there is a wood texture you don't notice it unless you're looking for it, but I'm sure on one of the solid color stands it would be very obvious.
