Beautiful piece. Matches my cabinets almost perfectly. Great price on sale. Poor quality control. Very disappointed. This island deserves 5 stars, however the drawers don't fit. After several hours of assembling the island, my son - working with 3 boys - 10, 9 & 9 - found that the middle drawer doesn't fit. The FACTORY INSTALLED tracks for the drawer are about 2" too low. The result is that there is a 2" gap above the drawer and the bottom drawer closes on the middle drawer. How does that happen? Doesn't a machine do the work - over and over and over? Isn't there an Inspector? See photos. The solution is to take the it apart, repack it, send it back, wait for a new one and start all over or do all of the above to receive a refund. Either way doesn't work for me. So i have a lovely, new island in my kitchen that looks like someone didn't read the assembly instructions. This is the second piece of furniture i purchased from Wayfair that didn't meet my expections. They don't make the furniture, but the vendors should be more careful and attentive to detail. Frankly, I'm a bit wary of furniture that need to be assembled. Update - 11.17.25. I am changing my rating from "2" to "4". Wayfair and the manufacturer were very kind, responsive and resolved my issue quickly. Their communications were outstanding.
