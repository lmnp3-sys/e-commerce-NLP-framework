We ordered this based on reviews that said they could put it together in an hour, It took a team of 2 experienced home builders and home renovation experts three hours, and as we watched them work, we realized we could never have tackled the job by ourselves. The multitude of tiny parts and teensy drawing, was daunting even prior to starting to start the build. When finished, it was a fine piece, but Wayfair needs to give an honest evaluation of the skills needed to accomplish the job. I would have had to return it simply to avoid the hours of frustration and difficulty involved. But, Wayfair does offer to put it together for $75, which would be money well spent for the novice.
