It's too soon to tell if this chair will work over time, but for now it's very nice. I just had it assembled today by one of Wayfair's assembly pros and had a great experience again (I had a table assembled some years ago). This chair is not bad looking for a task chair. I had resisted getting one for my apartment because I thought most of them were pretty ugly. The only thing that I think is unsightly is the way the bright silver screw heads show in the back - it would have been nice to have screw head covers in black. And for those of you who want to assemble this yourselves, be aware that the assembly pro (Gerry) had to use one of his power tools when assembling it - apparently, the box did not provide all the proper tools to put it together right.
